🧠 Overview

This experiment demonstrates a predictive AI monitoring system that automatically detects model performance drift in real time. It combines data analysis and behavioral metrics to enable proactive model supervision throughout the ML lifecycle.

✏️ Objective

To develop and test a lightweight framework capable of identifying data or performance drift before it affects accuracy, supporting stable and trustworthy model deployment.

📗 Results

The model achieved consistent detection of drift events and successfully visualized performance changes. Accuracy dropped after simulated drift, validating the importance of predictive monitoring for maintaining production stability.

📓 Notes

This workflow can be extended to integrate continuous monitoring pipelines and automated retraining triggers in MLOps environments.
